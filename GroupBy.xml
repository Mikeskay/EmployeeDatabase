1) List the department number and average salary of each 
department

SELECT deptno, ROUND(AVG(sal), 2) AS Average_Salary
FROM emp
GROUP BY deptno
ORDER BY deptno;
 
2) Divide all employees into groups by department and by 
job within department. Count the employees in each group 
and compute each groups average annual salary

SELECT deptno, COUNT(empno) AS Employee_Count, job, AVG(sal)*12 AS Avg_Annual_Salary
FROM emp
GROUP BY deptno, job
ORDER BY deptno;
 
3) Issue the same query as above except list the department name 
rather than the department number

SELECT dept.dname, COUNT(empno) AS Employee_Count, job, AVG(sal)*12 AS Avg_Annual_Salary
FROM emp 
INNER JOIN dept ON emp.deptno = dept.deptno
GROUP BY dept.dname, job
ORDER BY dept.dname;
 
4) List the average annual salary for all job groups having more 
than 2 employees in the group

SELECT job, COUNT(empno) AS Employee_Count, ROUND(AVG(sal) * 12, 2)
FROM emp
HAVING COUNT(empno) > 2
GROUP BY job
ORDER BY job;
 
5) List all the departments that have at least two clerks

SELECT job, deptno, COUNT(job)
FROM emp
HAVING job = 'CLERK'
AND COUNT(job) > 1
GROUP BY job, deptno
ORDER BY deptno;

 
6) Find all departments with an average commission greater than 
25% of average salary

SELECT DISTINCT emp.deptno, loc, ROUND(AVG(coalesce(comm,0)), 2) AS Average_Commission, COUNT(empno), AVG(sal)/4
FROM emp
INNER JOIN dept
ON emp.deptno = dept.deptno
GROUP BY emp.deptno, loc
HAVING ROUND(AVG(coalesce(comm,0)), 2) > AVG(sal)/4;
 
7) Find each departments average annual salary for all its 
employees except the manager's and the president's

SELECT ROUND(AVG(sal)*12, 2)
FROM emp
INNER JOIN dept
ON emp.deptno = dept.deptno
WHERE job NOT IN ('MANAGER', 'PRESIDENT');
 
8) List the average annual salary for all job groups having more 
than two employees in a group

SELECT job, COUNT(empno) AS Employee_Count
FROM emp
INNER JOIN dept
ON emp.deptno = dept.deptno
GROUP BY job
HAVING COUNT(empno) >= 2
ORDER BY COUNT(empno) DESC;
